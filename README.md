# Hey, I'm Marcus 👋

**30 years building systems where failure isn't an option. Now building with AI.**

Banking. Insurance. Telecom. Government. Real money, real consequences, not demos. I've shipped production code since before Git existed—and I'm more excited about building software today than I've ever been.

I'm an **AI-native developer** now. Claude is my copilot. The three decades of enterprise experience? That's what keeps me from over-engineering and under-delivering.

## What I'm Building

| Project | What it does | Why it matters |
|---------|--------------|----------------|
| [iOS Health Sync](https://github.com/mneves75/ai-health-sync-ios) | Sync HealthKit data iPhone ↔ Mac | Your health data. Your devices. No cloud. |
| [Mega-Sena Analyzer](https://github.com/mneves75/megasena-analyser-webapp) | Lottery statistics and bet generator | Data science for the masses. No predictions, just math. |
| [DNSChat](https://github.com/mneves75/dnschat) | LLM chat over DNS queries | Sometimes the constraint is the feature |
| [Polymarket Analyzer](https://github.com/mneves75/polymarket-analyzer) | Real-time prediction markets TUI | Production-grade terminal tooling |
| [clawdbot](https://github.com/mneves75/clawdbot) | Personal AI across all messengers | WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord, Signal, iMessage |

## How I Think

```
Ship beats perfect.
Clarity over cleverness.
Privacy is baseline, not feature.
Mobile-first is not optional.
John Carmack is reviewing my code.
```

## Tech I Reach For

**Languages:** TypeScript, Swift
**Mobile:** React Native, Expo, SwiftUI
**Backend:** Bun, PostgreSQL, Supabase
**AI:** Claude (obviously)

## Beyond Code

I teach AI and development in Portuguese at [conhecendoia.com.br](https://conhecendoia.com.br) — because knowledge shouldn't require a language tax.
