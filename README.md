# Marcus Neves

**AI-native full-stack builder** — shipping mobile apps, terminal tools, and whatever solves the problem.

Based in Brazil. Building with Claude as copilot.

**Data & ML** — I turn messy datasets into decisions. Data analysis, ML pipelines, pattern recognition. The interesting problems live where the data is ambiguous and the stakes are real.

## Philosophy

> "John Carmack is reviewing my code" — clarity over cleverness, correctness first

> "Ship beats perfect" — a working prototype today beats a perfect plan next month

> "Mobile-first, always" — if it doesn't work on a phone, it doesn't work
